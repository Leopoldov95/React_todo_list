## General Info
This is a Todo List created using ReactJS. The purpose of this project is to create a working Todo List based on a set of criterea given by Rapptr Labs.

## Challenges
This project took me a few days to create from start to finish. I was able to quickly create the markup as well as the styling. Having used React in the past, I was familiar with it's tools and features such as React Hooks and using States. When it came to the logic such as allowing the user to edit, delete, or add new items, I was able to draw upon the knowledge I had built based on previous projects I had worked on. The most difficult part of this assessment however was making a POST request to the provided API URL. I realized that I had only ever created GET requests with external API's, I have only ever created a POST request when communicating with a server I had created. This was rather problematic as I was presented with a challenge I had never faces before. I easily spent several hours researching this issue. In the end, I realized that I had to send form/body data in a specific way (I couldn't just pass it as params). Second, and more importantly, I had to adjust the headers when making the request, something I admittedly never did before. After dealing with the POST request issue the reast of the project went smoothly. I quite enjoyed working on it and I hope that my code is up to standards.
